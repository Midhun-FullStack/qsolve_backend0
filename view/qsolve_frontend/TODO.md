 # TODO - React Frontend Implementation for Q Solve

## Overview
Implement a React frontend application based on the Adobe XD design provided by the user. The app will be clean, maintainable, and follow React best practices with Tailwind CSS styling.

## Steps

1. **Initialize React App** ✅
   - Create a new React app in `qsolve_frontend/` using Create React App or Vite.
   - Setup Bootstrap for styling (instead of Tailwind as per user preference).

2. **Setup Routing** ✅
   - Install and configure React Router.
   - Create routes for Home, About, Dashboard pages.

3. **Project Structure** ✅
   - Create folders: `components/`, `hooks/`, `pages/`, `utils/`.
   - Organize files accordingly.

     - Splash ✅
     - Landing ✅
     - Login ✅
     - Registration ✅
     - Home ✅
     - About ✅
     - Department/Dashboard screens ✅

5. **API Integration**
   - Setup Axios or fetch for API calls.
   - Implement sample list display fetched from API.
   - Implement form input with validation and submission.

6. **State Management**
   - Use React Hooks (useState, useEffect) for state and lifecycle.

7. **Error Handling**
   - Add error boundary component.
   - Handle loading and error states gracefully.

8. **Prop Validation**
   - Use PropTypes for component props validation.

    - Ensure UI is responsive for desktop and mobile using Tailwind CSS.

11. **Deployment Setup**
    - Add instructions and configuration for deployment on Vercel or Netlify.

12. **Code Quality**
    - Write clean, commented code following React best practices.

- Use functional components and React Hooks.
- Prioritize maintainability and scalability.
